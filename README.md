# MECHANICAL.
# 1)Assembly & Simulation
The tasks includes to design a robotic arm gripper using the Fusion 360 Software. The design parameters are in mm. This is a **Pnematic Gripper** which is used in many industry scale applications.

# 2) Computational Fluid Dynamics
This task involves performing Computational fluid behaviour on the Airfoil we designed in the previous task. The environment which is used is air. The input velocity hitting the camber line is 50 m/s and the output is 0m/s. The airfoil chosen is NACA2414. 25 iterations have been successfully performed on the airfoil

# 3) Piston and crankshaft mechanism
This task we had to design a piston and a crankshaft mechanism which can run.The piston and crankshaft mechanism is a fundamental component of internal combustion engines, converting reciprocating (linear) motion into rotational motion. It consists of:
1)Piston – A cylindrical component that moves up and down inside the cylinder due to expanding gases from fuel combustion.
2)Connecting Rod – Links the piston to the crankshaft, transferring motion while allowing angular movement.
3)Crankshaft – A rotating shaft that converts the piston's linear motion into rotational motion, ultimately driving the vehicle's wheels or machinery
As the piston moves due to combustion, it pushes the connecting rod, which rotates the crankshaft in a continuous cycle. This mechanism is essential for engines in cars, motorcycles, and other machinery.
